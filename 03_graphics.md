Failing Graphics Card
---

The graphics card also had some problems for this model. [According to Apple](https://www.apple.com/support/macbookpro-videoissues/), "...a small percentage of MacBook Pro systems may exhibit distorted video, no video, or unexpected system restarts." Starting in late 2014, I had distorted video. I provide some screen shots below. The Geniuses have an automated program to test the video card. Mine passed, no doubt befuddling whoever was responsible for actually fixing my computer. 

#### My Experience Summary
