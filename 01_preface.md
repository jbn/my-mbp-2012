Recently, I did something shitty. There was a victim, and I was the transgressor. I'll spare the details except the preface to her conclusion: "I'm going to say this as nice as a I can." I'd like to borrow that grace when listing my grievances with Apple and my **MacBook Pro (Retina, Mid 2012)**. Except, it's less about borrowing as it is about imitating. If Apple were a person, I'd call that person an asshole. Instead of doing that, I'll just try to present the facts with a less Jersey-born-and-bred vernacular.
