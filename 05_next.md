Next Steps
---

I have to bring my laptop to the Apple Store again, before my 90-day extended warrantee for the last failed repair expires. I've been putting it off because I can't spare the lost time. I have strenuous deadlines. Losing my computer makes me miss them. That makes me look bad. Right now, I'm deciding if I should just eat the out-of-warrantee expense. It's cost-benefit analysis. If I bring it before October 30th, they should repair it for free. But, at a minimum, it will take 4 days. I'll probably miss my deadlines, which hurts me more. 

As a result of bad support, Apple will probably make more money from me. That's absurd and pisses me off. But, their marketing is so clever, that it probably won't affect them at all. I've been holding off on buying a new IPhone for 6 months, thinking "if they don't fix this properly, I'll switch." Except, I probably won't. They have their talons in me. Instead, I'll just write this to make me feel slightly better about it all.

...Okay. I think I failed to immitate even-tempered. Passive agressive is not graceful. Let the Jersey speak -- Apple, fix my shit!
