Next Steps
---

I don't know how to estimate my lost productivity from the halts. Or, from going to the Apple store repeatedly, without resolution. Or, from waiting a several days each time for my laptop -- with a carefully crafted development environment -- to come back to me. But, I think it's fair to say, it cost me several times the expense of the laptop. That is not consumer-friendly.

I have to bring my laptop to the Apple Store again, before my 90-day extended warrantee for the last failed repair expires. I've been putting it off because I can't spare the lost time. I have strenuous deadlines. Losing my computer makes me miss them. That makes me look bad. Right now, I'm deciding if I should just eat the out-of-warrantee expense. It's cost-benefit analysis. If I bring it before October 30th, they should (attempt to) repair it for free. But, at a minimum, it will take 4 days. I'll probably miss my deadlines, which hurts me more. 

As a result of bad support, Apple will probably make more money from me. That's absurd and pisses me off. But, their marketing is so clever, that it probably won't affect them at all. I've been holding off on buying a new IPhone for six months, thinking "if they don't fix this properly, I'll switch." Except, I probably won't. They have their talons in me. Instead, I'll just write this to make me feel slightly better about it all.

And yes, I failed spectacularly in saying this "as nice as I can." Passive aggressive and snark-filled is not graceful. But, hey, it's way more polite than it could have been.
