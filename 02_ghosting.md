The Retina Ghosting / Image Persistence Issue
---
There have been problems with my MBP Retina Display since day one. It's not an uncommon problem.  Apple offers an [official solution on their support pages](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202580). Basically, it's "**use a screen saver**." Thanks, Apple. That's not my problem. And, you -- you personified corporation, you -- know it. And I know you know it. How?

Well, for one, the Apple-hosted discussion boards are overflowing with complaints on this exact issue. For (just one) example, see [this thread](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4034848?start=15) started **June 21th, 2012**. It has **1,700,172 views** and **9,614 replies**. Admittedly, the discussion forums rarely have any official Apple sanction responses. As far as I can tell, it exists as a pressure bleed valve. People get angry and yell at virtual Apple, slaking their incipient blood-lust for revenge. Then, they go back to doing what they were doing. It's about as effective at yelling at a rock. That's doubly true for the many [YouTube videos demonstrating the issue](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=mbp+retina+ghosting&search_sort=video_view_count), many of which have 100,000+ views.

But, there is a better example of Apple knowing about the problem and actively choosing to ignore it. [Beau Hodges tried to put together a class action law suit against them](http://arstechnica.com/apple/2013/03/apple-hit-with-class-action-lawsuit-over-defective-retina-displays/). [U.S. District Judge William H. Orrick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_H._Orrick_III) foolishly [threw it out](http://topclassactions.com/lawsuit-settlements/lawsuit-news/4749-judge-dismisses-macbook-retina-display-class-action-lawsuit/) "[b]ecause, fundamentally, Hodges [did] not [identify] any affirmative misrepresentation made by Apple." Okay, so legally Apple got away with it. But, obviously they knew about it. And, no, **it is a misrepresentation to professionals who use computers**. As you may be aware, a lot of Mac owners like to create things, especially visual art. Often, visual art must be pixel perfect. It is very hard to achieve such perfection if the screen doesn't represent the pixels properly in the first place. Although, to be fair, it's not clear that Apple could have done a full (and appropriate) recall. [It's a very cash-poor company](http://techcrunch.com/2015/07/21/apple-now-has-203-billion-in-cash-on-hand/#.owio6q:vO3h).
