Appendix A: Genius Bar Work Authorizations
---

I suspect most of the training Apple Store Geniuses receive pertains to dealing with irate customers. The general bewilderment displayed when I open up a terminal in front of them suggests the training is not tech-related. However, I still expected them to properly transcribe experiences. Below are my Apple Store Work authorizations. I comment on each one below the quote blocks.

#### Apple Store Georgetown, 21-Mar-13

> Problem Description/Diagnosis

> Issue: Customer states he is having a **ghosting issue** with display. For example, If machine goes to a screen saver, previous applications that the customer was using will be visible on the display. Customer states that he primarily uses computer for programming and illustrator. He states that the issue occurs when he is actively using the machine. Ghosting also occurs when switching between desktops. Customer states **fans make an unusual noise during usage**, he states that they sound obstructed (near back right). He states when position of computer is changed, noise stops.

> Steps to Reproduce: -Reviewed support article HT5455 on image persistence with customer
-unable to reproduce issues at the bar. 
Proposed Resolution: -Run full diagnostics on machine
-Run image persistence test
-I am ordering parts in the event any components fail diagnostics, replace components as necessary.

> Cosmetic Condition: Minor scratches on bottom case

> Known Liquid Damage: No

> Check-in Required: Yes

> Username: XXX

> Password: applestore

> Would the customer prefer to create a temporary password while their computer is being serviced?: Yes

> Estimated Turn Around Time: We'll call you in 3 - 5 days

> Work Authorization: Customer states computer is backed up.

> Mac OS Version: 10.8.2

> Hard Drive Size: 251 GB

> Memory Size: 16 GB

> iLife Version: n/a

First of all, no -- I demonstrated image persistence at the bar. I showed it to the employee. Apparently, he didn't think it was significant, writing "unable to reproduce issues at the bar." I didn't notice this when I left that day, but I should have. Mea culpa. In any case, the persistence issue was not what occurred when "[I was] actively using the machine." That referred to the fan making a bad sound at heavy CPU utilization. 

They solved my problem by **blowing compressed air** into my machine. Unexpectedly, this did not repair the persistence issue. 



#### Apple Store Willowbrook NJ, 21-Feb-15

> Problem Description/Diagnosis

> Issue: Customer stated that they frequently see **distortion** while changing desktops and while using most applications, the display will **flicker**. This issue was **verified** by customer recording issue happening.

> Steps to Reproduce: Issue was verified by watching video of issue happening. Certain images are **ghosted** on desktop as well as flickering and **image color/distortion**.

> Cosmetic Condition: No notable damage found on machine

> Proposed Resolution: Send to depot repair.

> Estimated Turn Around Time: We'll call you in 3 - 5 days

> Mac OS Version: 10.10.1

> Hard Drive Size: 251 GB

> Memory Size: 16 GB

> iLife Version: n/a

> Employee XXXXXXXXXX

Two years later, I had a week off where I could afford to be without a computer. So, I went again. Plus, some new issues were percolating. This time, I understood more about the Genius Bar process. That is, *it's about customer management, not technical support*. I went in with images and videos to demonstrate the problem, and to intimate that -- yes, I have durable evidence. The Genius recorded the problem in a more accurate way. 

Apple responded with Apple-typical bravado. They **replaced the Logic Board**. Once again, unexpectedly, this did not solve the persistence problem. It also had no effect on the visual distortions. I suspect the video card produces them, but I'm not hardware specialist. 



#### Apple Store West 14th St, 31-Jul-15


> Problem Description/Diagnosis

> Issue: Customer says (and has screen captures of) **kernel panics** that have been intermittenly occurring once or twice a day. Computer **loses connection** to connected external monitor and reverts back to internal only. He also says that he has repeatedly complained of **Ghosting issues** that he believes is a known and documented issue and requests we replace the LG branded Liquid Crystal Display Panel.

> Steps to Reproduce: Visually confirmed customer was able to created a ghosted image with a Finder window left in place for **less than a minute**. Macintosh Resource Inspector detects all components and recommends running Video Systems Test, 

> Cosmetic Condition: Mild cosmetic smudges. No visible damage detected during physical inspection. 

> Proposed Resolution: Sending computer to Apple Repair Facilty under Extended Warranty coverage. All data is fully backed. Turnaround time is 4-6 business days. Customer understands that if evidence of tampering or moisture contact are discovered we may re-quote repair service.

> Estimated Turn Around Time: We'll call you in 3 - 5 days

> Mac OS Version: 10.10.x

> Hard Drive Size: 256

> Memory Size: 16

> iLife Version: Unknown

> Contact Apple Support Case: XXXXXXXXX

> Employee XXXXXXXX

The employee at this store was great (not sarcasm). I came in angry. I told him from the get-go, "I'm angry. I'm not directing this at you. I know you have no responsibility here. But, this is bullshit." He was calm, and meticulously documented everything I was saying. And, by now, the screen was the least of my concerns. The daily onslaught of fully-halting kernel panics was more of a problem.

A week later, behold! After three years, **they replaced the LG display**! Way to be a stand-up corporate citizen, Apple! As for the kernel panics, they went with the tried-and-true approach. They **replaced the Logic Board, again**. Unexpectedly, this did not fix the kernel panics. And, it did not fix the video distortion problem, either.
