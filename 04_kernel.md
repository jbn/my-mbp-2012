Kernel Panics
---

By mid-March, my computers pathology had progressed to frequent halts and restarts. Given that my graphics card has problems, and Apple states that the video card may produce "unexpected system restarts" I assume the fault lies with the graphics card. This is the most severe of this infernal contraption's problems. You know what's not fun? Trying to write your dissertation on a laptop that kernel panics twice daily. Especially when your dissertation is heavily computational, with simulations that take hours or days to run. And, need to be fully restarted given a kernel panic. I don't know how to estimate my lost productivity from the halts. Or, from going to the Apple store repeatedly, without resolution. Or, from waiting a several days each time for my laptop -- with carefully a constructed development environment -- to come back to me. But, I think it's fair to say, it cost me several times the expense of the laptop. That is not consumer-friendly.
